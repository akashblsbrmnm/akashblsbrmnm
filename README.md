I am a Software Developer with 1.5+ years of experience with a strong background in feature development and system optimization for RDK-B platforms. Proficient in C/C++, Linux Shell Scripting, CMake, AutoConf, Python and Java.
My expertise lies in feature development and integration into RDK-B, alongside regression testing and verification on CPE devices. I have extensive experience with Bash scripting and autotools to streamline the compilation and build process. This ensures efficient and reliable development workflows, contributing to robust and high-performance embedded systems.
